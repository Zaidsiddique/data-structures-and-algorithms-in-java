//In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix 
//into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.

//You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of 
//rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.

//The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in 
//the same row-traversing order as they were.

//If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new 
//reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

    if (r * c != t) {

        int[][] arr = new int[r][c];
        int a = 0, b = 0;
